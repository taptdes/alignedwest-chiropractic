## TL;DR

- Use Conventional Commits
- Format: `<type>(scope): summary`
- Keep summary ≤ 50 chars
- Use `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, etc.
- Use `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` for breaking changes

# 📝 Commit Message Guidelines

This repo follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification to standardize commit messages and enable automated versioning via `semantic-release`.

All commits **must** follow the format below.

---

## ✨ Format

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <short, imperative summary>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
````

---

## 🔧 Types

Use one of the following types:

| Type       | Purpose                               | Version Impact        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature                         | 🚀 Minor version bump |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                             | 🛠 Patch version bump |
| `chore`    | Maintenance (e.g. deps, configs)      | 🚫 No version bump    |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                 | 🚫 No version bump    |
| `style`    | Code style changes (formatting, etc.) | 🚫 No version bump    |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring (no behavior change) | 🚫 No version bump    |
| `perf`     | Performance improvements              | 🚫 No version bump    |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests              | 🚫 No version bump    |
| `build`    | Changes to build tools or CI/CD       | 🚫 No version bump    |

## 🔍 Examples

```bash
feat: add search filters to listings page
fix: correct image path in property card
chore: update Tailwind to v4
docs: add README section on commit standards
style: format components using Prettier
refactor(web): simplify listing pagination logic
```

---

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

To indicate a breaking change, add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body or use `!` after the type:

```bash
feat!: remove support for legacy auth flow

BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication now uses Auth0 only.
```

> This will trigger a **major** version bump.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use the **imperative** mood ("add", not "added" or "adds").
- Keep summaries to **50 characters or less**.
- Leave an empty line between the subject and body (if body is included).
- Use the body to explain **why**, not just **what**.

---

## 🚀 Use the `.gitmessage` Template (Optional but Recommended)

1. Create a `.gitmessage` file at the root of your repo with this content:

   ```bash
   # <type>(optional-scope): short, imperative summary

   # Example:
   # feat(listings): add filter by property type
   # fix(header): correct logo alignment on mobile
   # chore: update Tailwind to v4

   # Types:
   # feat | fix | chore | docs | style | refactor | perf | test | build

   <type>(scope): your concise message here

   # Optional body:
   # - What changed and why?
   # - Any relevant context or links.

   # BREAKING CHANGE: Describe breaking change here
   ```

2. Configure Git to use this template:

   ```bash
   git config commit.template .gitmessage
   ```

3. Then, when committing, run:

   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

   Git will open the template in your default text editor for editing.

## When to Use Scopes

Scopes help identify which part of the codebase the commit affects.

Examples:

- `feat(api): add appointment endpoint`
- `fix(forms): correct validation error`
- `refactor(utils): simplify date formatter`

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ `fixed bug in code` → Not using a valid type  
❌ `feat: adds new API` → Should be imperative: _add_, not _adds_  
❌ `feat(api)` → Missing summary  
❌ `update stuff` → Too vague

---

## ✅ Why It Matters

- Enables automated versioning and changelog generation via semantic-release.
- Improves project history readability.
- Makes PRs and releases easier to scan and understand.
